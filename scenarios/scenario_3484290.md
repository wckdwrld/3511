# Scenario: Jack

## Persona: Trevor (32)

Each day Trevor drives to his nearest train station, almost half an hour away, and boards a train into the city. In the evenings he receives a notification from the application that another user is requesting a lift to the train station the following morning, he is given the option to accept or decline the request. He chooses to accept. The next morning, before he leaves for work, Trevor is reminded via a notification that he must collect the other user, he enters his destination and a route is defined on the map such that there is a location where he must collect the other user. 

Trevor has now collected the other user and they arrive at the train station. Trevor has completed such a journey multiple times and has engaged with many people that have shared the route. As such, Trevor now has a list of friends that share his commuting path, he can see who is catching the train today and can request to meetup on board.
